I will be postponing the post of the 30 days of pwn for a couple of months while I focus on the learnings from the [PWK course](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/).

I decided to purchase the PWK course today with hopes of passing the OSCP exam. I started learning about cyber security in september of last year so it would be really nice to complete the OSCP in that first year of learning.

Starting from tomorrow I will post about other learnings that are focussed away from the pwn subject.
